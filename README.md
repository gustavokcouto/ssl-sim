=======

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT SUITABLE FOR USAGE YET.

This is a physics simulator for Robocup Small Size League.
Main goals are:

1. Fast, consistent and fast physics.
2. Simple API for usage in code to aid AI.
3. Stand-alone GUI which speaks default protocols (grSim and ssl-vision).
4. Integrated referee for fully unsupervised matches.
