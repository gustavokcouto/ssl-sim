Small Size League Simulator (Experimental)
------------------------------------------

This is an experimental simulator using the Bullet Physics Engine to
aid on the development of AIs for this Robocup category.

The initial purpose is a simple simulator which receives the grSim protocol
end sends the SSL Vision protocol.

It is not the purpose of this project to provide a good graphical interface
that purpose seems much more fit to grSim which in the future will be able
to benefit from this project which uses Bullet to provide fast physics.

Futurely this should become a framework to allow simulation for other purposes
than merley being able to play a game. And so, be used in the grSim to replace
ODE with Bullet.
